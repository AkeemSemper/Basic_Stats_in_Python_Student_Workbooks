Things I really need students to be capable of for the ML class:

<ul>
  <li> Understand errors and accuracy (RMSE, R2, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix...) and the idea of evaluating models. </li>
  <li> Sampling, estimation, and hypothesis testing. Especially the idea of building trials to run experiments. </li>
  <li> Make Bayes classifier from scratch. </li>
  <li> Linear and logistic regression in sklearn. </li>
  <li> Pipelines, imputation, encoding in sklearn. </li>
  <li> Moving average based time series, with an introduction of trend, cyclicality, stationary. </li>
  <li> Basic understanding of gradient descent, including the internal calculations. This is important.</li>
  <li> Within the gradient descent part, an idea of loss and cost. </li>
  <li> Seaborn Visualizations. </li>
  <li> VS Code, git, and github. </li>
 </ul>
 
 In general, if the students are able, go faster and I will just progress more when they get to the ML class. They need to be comfortable with sklearn pipelines with some data prep, at a minimum, to be able to pick up and work in the ML class.
