    "The values that are produced by your code here will be tested automatically by a testing file. This is common in real programming - as code is submitted an automated script runs the new code and verifies that it actually works and does what it is intended to. This requires that you match exactly what is asked for, even if your work is equivalent or effectively the same as the defined answer, it can still be marked incorrect. There is some precision required in coding - if an answer is required to be an integer of 7, producing a float of 7.0 is different. This is picky and frustrating at times, but it really does matter. If another part of a program is expecting data in a certain format, we need to produce answers in that exact format in order for things to work. "
