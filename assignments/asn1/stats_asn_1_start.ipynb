    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you'll load some data into a python notebook, and use some basic functions to do some basic analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Preamble\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that we can do in notebooks is format things with code and text in a smart and presentable way. One of the things that this assignment will cover is the basics of making things look nice and clear. Text in these markup cells can be formatted with HTML-ish code to make them nice. If you don't know any HTML, it is pretty easy to implement, here's some samples that you can copy for formatting. Overall, the goal here is to make it clear what your answers are, and communicate it to the reader (me). Please use things like headers, labels, lists, etc... to make your findings readable. Double click the text in a markup cell to make it editable and see the markup examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "Headers can be made by using pound signs in front of the text like above. 1 pound sign is H1 (big header) and the size scales down as more pound signs are added, down to 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can be created using HTML markups. Here is an example of a number and non-numbered list, the non-numbered one has an additional level of indenting:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li> Some point\n",
    "<li> The next point\n",
    "<li> One more point\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Stuff \n",
    "<li> Lots of stuff with details\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Sub-point\n",
    "    <li> More sub-points\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> More stuff\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also do things like bold and italic, with new lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> I'm bold</b><br>\n",
    "<i> I'm italic</i><br>\n",
    "<b><i> I'm both </i></b><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More Info\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot more that can be used to make things pretty. You don't need to be an artist or a web designer, just make it clear. There is a pdf (jupyter_markdown.pdf) in this repository and on Moodle which shows examples of far more stuff.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at this (https://www.kaggle.com/firefliesqn/tuning-deepsort-helmet-mapping ) for formatting/layout example – sections are labelled, there’s an explanation, it’s easy to read. Ignore the contents, that’s totally different. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to have something that someone can read through and make sense of. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the files in this repository is a test harness. This is what I will use to check the answers for the parts that are exact. The only part that is missing from what you have here is a file with the asnwers. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can run this file to check yours as you work, you will need to make a few changes:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> The answers in the test harness are currently set to be read from an answer file. You'll want to comment that out, and set those variables to raw values. \n",
    "<li> If you run it, it will check if the results of your code match whatever \"answer\" you provide. \n",
    "<li> This isn't super complex, but it does require a little thought. You don't need to do this for the assignment at all, but if you feel comfortable with the coding, this is good practice. \n",
    "<li> <b>Even if you don't actually use the testing, the test harness shows how your functions will be \"called\" (used), the code in the test harness executes the corresponding functions in your file. This should function, even if you aren't actually checking your results. </b>\n",

The function <b>should not</b> pull in any other varaibles from the body of our code, it has all that it needs already. This is important, as someone could take this one function, paste it in other programs, and use it as is - that is effectively what we do with the libraries we import. \n",

    "We could even take the value, and compare it to a known answer. This is how we test code to make sure it works without error, we can write a \"test harness\" to run the code, capture the values, and check if they are correct. In real life we could test a large range of values, automatically. Usually the most important tests are those at the \"edges\", or things that are borderline or uncommon. For example, here we'd likely focus on decimals, negatives, 0s, and non-numerical inputs as things we know we need to test. If the function does fine with (2,2), it'll probably be ok with (5,14), but a 0 or -23.452 may be different enough to cause something unexpected. \n",
